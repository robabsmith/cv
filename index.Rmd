Robert Smith {#title}

```{r}
intro_text <- "Through work and education experience I have developed a great interest in business processes and the flow of information between functional components of an organisation.

My work experience is quite diverse and has given me insights into a wide variety of markets and value chains, and the motivations of corporates and individuals involved in business growth initiatives. Experience in the investment advice industry allowed me to learn client management, operational and budget planning, together with the technical and regulatory aspects of the industry.

Further education and development have followed me through all roles in one way or another, and my most recent role as a PhD fellow is another example. Data analysis, programming and the Danish economy as the central learning elements."
